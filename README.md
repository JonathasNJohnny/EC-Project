# Getting Started with Flask

always remember to create a server.py flask-server file.

### `python server.py run`

Runs the flask-server, use this command in the project directory.

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it on your browser.
Or add the flask-server proxy to your project, example: "proxy": "http://localhost:5000".


### If you need to check the flask documentations, you can access it here: [https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)
